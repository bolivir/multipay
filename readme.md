        'paypal' => [
            'client_id' => '',
            'secret' => '',
            'mode' => 'sandbox',
            'currency' => 'EUR',
            'return_url' => '',
            'cancel_url' => '',
        ],
        ...other available providers
    ],
```

## How to use
If you have configured the desired payment provider you want to use you can use multipay like below:


#### Perform a purchase action
```php
// Create the meta for the payment
$paymentMeta = new \Bolivir\Multipay\PaymentMeta();
$paymentMeta->addDetail('customer_number', 'foo');

// Create the multi pay instance and set the provider
$multiPay = new \Bolivir\Multipay\MultiPay();
$multiPay->setProvider('paypal');

// Make the purchase
$multiPay->purchase($paymentMeta);
```

#### Perform a capture action
Some providers do not directly capture the funds and instead it will approve the purchase request, but you need to manually capture the funds.
This can be done by calling the `capture` function. The following providers needs manual capture:
```php
$transactionId = 'xxx' // The transaction id you got when calling purchase
$body = [
    // Paypal example body, this id you will get when they redirect back to the callback url
    'payer_id' => 'xxxxx',
]
// Create the multi pay instance and set the provider
$multiPay = new \Bolivir\Multipay\MultiPay();
$multiPay->setProvider('paypal');
$multiPay->capture($transactionId, $body);
```

#### Perform a verify action
You can verify if a purchase was succesfully by calling the `verify` method
```php
$transactionId = 'xxx' // The transaction ID you get when the provider calls your callback URL.
// Create the multi pay instance and set the provider
$multiPay = new \Bolivir\Multipay\MultiPay();
$multiPay->setProvider('paypal');
$multiPay->verify($transactionId);
```
